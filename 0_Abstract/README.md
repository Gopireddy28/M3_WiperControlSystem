# **Wiper Control System**

# ABSTRACT :

A wiper is a vital component that cleans raindrops or any other liquid from the windscreen of a car. Previously, the wipers had to be activated manually by setting the frequency. The operation of increasing the wiper speed is modified as a result. The project's purpose is to improve the systems of older cars by providing automated transmission. wiping technology, to improve the system by including a sensor and actuator, and to develop a basic programme that would work with the system completely. the structure The principle of this proposed wiper system is similar to that of other existing conventional wipers. Regardless of the fact that To drain water from the windscreen, this system will be updated to an automatic control system using a Peripheral Interface.



## **About Wiper Control System**

## **Abstract**

Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen. The previous system used to activate the wiper manually and the process of pulling up the wiper is difficult to be handled. Thus, this system is proposed to solve these problems. The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing wiping system, to improve the system by using actuator and pull switch(using same switch for multi purpose by stepwise switching) and controlling the engine and speed of the wipers with the single switch.

## **Description**

Wiper Control System is an Electronic device which is a alternative from the normal wiper tool in the cars in this system we will use the single switch to control the Ignition button(On the Motor) on ACC position As a first press and on the wiper system by pressing the button second time and Changing the speed of the wipers on the third press of the button and by pressing the button fourth time the motor will be OFF on the lock position. And all this process was done by using LED's in simulation Tool.

## **Features**

  - ON The Motor(Ignition Position)
  - OFF the Motor
  - Power ON Wipers
  - Speed Controll of wipers
